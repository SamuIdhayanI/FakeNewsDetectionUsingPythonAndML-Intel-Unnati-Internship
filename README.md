Fake news is an upcoming yet huge problem in today’s digital age where anyone can share anything irrespective of its truthfulness. Information is available freely yet it comes with a very expensive cost that is fake information. In order to combat this, we have chosen certain machine learning models and algorithms to detect fake news that clouds our everyday feed. The objective of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate model that can classify news articles as either genuine or fake.

The project generates accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports for each model. Here are the performance results for the models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVC

The results demonstrate that the implemented machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, and SVM, exhibit high accuracy and strong performance in detecting fake news. These models can be valuable tools in combatting misinformation and verifying the authenticity of news articles.
